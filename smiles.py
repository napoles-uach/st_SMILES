with st.sidebar.expander('Rule Two (Simple Chains)'):
  st.markdown('''
  ## Simple chains
  * Structures are hydrogen suppresed (Molecules represented without hydrogens)
  * If enough bonds are not identified by the user, the system will assume that connections
  are satisfied by hidrogens.
  * The user can explicitly identify hydrogen bonds, but if so the interpreter will assume that all of them are fully identified.
  Note:
  
  *Because SMILES allows entry of all elements in the periodic table, 
  and also utilizes hydrogen suppression, the user should be aware of chemicals with two letters 
  that could be misinterpreted by the computer. For example, 'Sc' could be interpreted as a **sulfur**
  atom connected to an aromatic **carbon** by a single bond, or it could be the symbol for **scandium**. 
  The SMILES interpreter gives priority to the interpretation of a single bond connecting a sulfur atom and an aromatic carbon. 
  To identify scandium the user should enter [Sc]*.

with st.sidebar.expander('Rule Three (Branches)'):
  st.markdown('''
  ## Branches
  * A branch from a chain is specified by placing the SMILES symbol(s) for the branch between parenthesis. 
  * The string in parentheses is placed directly after the symbol for the atom to which it is connected. 
  * If it is connected by a double or triple bond, the bond symbol immediately follows the left parenthesis.
  ''')

with st.sidebar.expander('Rule Four (Rings)'):
  st.markdown('''
  ## Rings
  * SMILES allows a user to identify ring structures by using numbers to identify the opening and closing ring atom.
  For example, in C1CCCCC1, the first carbon has a number '1' which connects by a single bond with the last carbon which also has a number '1'. 
  The resulting structure is cyclohexane. Chemicals that have multiple rings may be identified by using different numbers for each ring.
  * If a double, single, or aromatic bond is used for the ring closure, the bond symbol is placed before the ring closure number.
  ''')

with st.sidebar.expander('Rule Five (Charged atoms)'):
  st.markdown('''
  ## Charged atoms
  Charges on an atom can be used to override the knowledge regarding valence that is built into SMILES software. 
  The format for identifying a charged atom consists of the atom followed by brackets which enclose the charge on the atom. 
  The number of charges may be explicitly stated ({-1}) or not ({-}).
